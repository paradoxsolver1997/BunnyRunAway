      <h1>The Story Begins</h1>

      <h2>The Mischief Plan</h2>
        <p>It’s another quiet afternoon in your garden. While you’re watering the flowers, you notice your little bunny getting restless again! This clever furball is plotting to sneak out and steal the neighbor’s fresh veggies. As the responsible owner, you must stop its “great escape” plan!</p>
      
      <h2>Catch the Trickster</h2>
        <p>The sneaky bunny has already dug four secret tunnels around your house, ready to dash out anytime. Luckily, it must cross several pebble paths and tree stumps before reaching any exit. You happen to have some portable fences that can block its way. But here’s the challenge: the fences are limited, and this smart bunny will always find the best route to escape. Can you outwit this furry little fugitive?</p>

      <h1>Game Objectives</h1>

      <h2>Bunny’s Goal</h2>
        <p>Find the quickest path to any tunnel and escape the garden. The bunny always runs at a steady pace along pebble paths but will instantly switch routes if a new shortcut opens up. Once it reaches any tunnel, you’re in trouble!</p>
      
      <h2>Player’s Goal</h2>
        <p>Use your limited fences to block every possible route before the bunny reaches a tunnel. Most of the time the bunny will surrender once cornered, but sometimes it will stubbornly hop a few steps within the trapped area. Don’t worry—if your blockade is tight enough, it will soon give up!</p>

      <h1>Game Elements</h1>

      <h2>Characters</h2>
      
      <h3>The Bunny</h3>
        <p>The main character that automatically searches for the shortest escape path.</p>
      
      <h2>Items</h2>
      
      <h3>Fence</h3>
        <p>A small barrier you can place on the path to block the bunny’s movement.</p>
      
      <h2>Environment</h2>
      
      <h3>Grass</h3>
        <p>Background only. The eco-friendly bunny never steps on grass.</p>
      <h3>Pebble Path</h3>
        <p>The bunny’s walkable path, where you can place fences (in most cases).</p>
      <h3>Tunnels</h3>
        <p>The bunny’s target exits. Reaching any one of them means the bunny wins.</p>
      <h3>Tree Stumps</h3>
        <p>Path nodes the bunny can pass through. You cannot place fences here.</p>
      <h3>Special Paths</h3>
        <p>You cannot place fences on tunnels’ direct connections or on the path currently occupied by the bunny.</p>

    <section id="controls">
      <h1>Game Controls</h1>

      <h2>Buttons</h2>
        <p>In the bottom-right corner, you’ll find four control buttons to manage the game flow:</p>
      
        <h3>Start/Stop/Restart</h3>
            <p>Begin, abort, or restart a game session.</p>
        <h3>Pause/Resume</h3>
            <p>If the bunny feels too fast and you need a breather, use this button to slow things down—but don’t overuse it!</p>
        <h3>Settings</h3>
            <p>Adjust difficulty (like bunny speed or fence count), display fonts, or sound volume. Settings are only available when the game is stopped.</p>
        <h3>Exit</h3>
            <p>Quit the game. Same as clicking the “X” at the top-right of the window.</p>          
        <h3>Language</h3>
            <p>Don’t forget you can switch languages by clicking the flag at the top-right! Currently, the game supports seven languages.</p>
      
      <h2>Status Info</h2>
        <p>In the top-right corner, you can check real-time game stats:</p>
      
      <h3>Bunny Status</h3>
        <p>Running / Stopped</p>
      <h3>Bunny Position</h3>
        <p>Last stump coordinate it passed</p>
      <h3>Escape Paths Count</h3>
        <p>Total number of possible escape routes</p>
      <h3>Fence Usage</h3>
        <p>Number of fences placed / Total available fences</p>

      <h1>Basic Operations</h1>
      
      <h2>Placing Fences</h2>
        <p>Left-click on a pebble path to place a fence. Click again to remove it.</p>
      
      <h2>Placement Limits</h2>
        <p>You can’t place fences on the bunny’s current path, directly on tunnels’ connections, on grass, or on tree stumps. Invalid placements are silently ignored for smoother gameplay.</p>
      
      <h2>Fence Limit</h2>
        <p>The total number of fences is limited, but you can change this in the settings to adjust difficulty. Don’t worry—the map is always designed to guarantee a possible solution. The question is: do you have the reflexes and strategy to trap your bunny?</p>
      
      <h2>Auto-Recycling</h2>
        <p>When you’ve used up all fences, placing a new one will automatically recycle the oldest fence and move it to the new spot. The fence about to be recycled will blink as a warning. You can also manually remove fences by clicking on them. Be careful—manual recycling costs you reaction time, while auto-recycling might break your setup. So, plan your placement order wisely!</p>
      
      <h2>Bunny’s Smart Behavior</h2>
        <p>Remember, your bunny is clever—it always knows the fastest way to the nearest tunnel. But you can use this against it by predicting its next move. Smart strategy goes a long way!</p>

    <section id="tips">
      <h1>Tips & Tricks</h1>
        <p>This game isn’t just about luck and fast clicks—there are real strategies! Certain areas of the map make it easier to trap the bunny. If you can spot these spots, lure the bunny toward them, and close in at the right time, you’ll win! It’s not just about blocking paths—it’s a brain battle between you and your bunny. Tricky enough, right?</p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      
      <h3>Find Key Areas</h3>
        <p>Certain regions are easier to trap the bunny.</p>
      <h3>Predict Routes</h3>
        <p>Use the bunny’s shortest-path behavior to your advantage.</p>
      <h3>Guiding Strategy</h3>
        <p>Steer the bunny into your chosen trap zone.</p>
      <h3>Blinking Warning</h3>
        <p>A fence that’s about to be recycled will blink red.</p>

    <section id="faq">
      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      
      <h2>Why doesn’t the path respond when I click it?</h2>
        <p>Probably because you clicked the bunny’s current path or a tunnel’s direct connection. Fences can’t be placed there. To avoid interruptions, the game simply ignores such invalid placements without warning.</p>
      
      <h2>Why is my fence blinking?</h2>
        <p>A blinking red fence means it’s about to be recycled to make room for a new one.</p>
      
      <h2>Why is the bunny still moving when it’s already trapped?</h2>
        <p>That’s normal! Even when cornered, the bunny may hop a few more steps. If you’re sure it’s trapped, just wait—it will soon give up. Be careful not to place a random new fence, or you might trigger auto-recycling and ruin your setup!</p>
      
      <h2>The bunny is too fast—what can I do?</h2>
        <p>No worries! Stop the game, adjust the bunny’s speed in the settings, and restart. Just remember: settings are only available when the game isn’t running.</p>
